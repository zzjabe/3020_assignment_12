## CI & CD

This assignment is a demo of peer review.

I will write something in the README file and commit it to the dev branch.

Then, I will create a pull request and add my classmate as the reviewer.

My classmate will review the file and comment on my pull request, then accept the changes.

Finally, I will merge the pull request back into the main branch.
